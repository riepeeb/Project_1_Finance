 #Hypothesis: The increase of Interest Rates will cause home buying by Millennials to decrease
  #Definitions in our Scope:
   #Millennial - a person aged 25-34
   #FFR - Federal Funds Rate
   #FMI - Fixed Mortgage Interest Rate
#For our project, we wanted to look at how the housing market has changed in the over the past 5 years.  We are all iaround the age that home buying is on our minds, so we wanted to look at trends concerning interest rates.  
#To do this, we first Googled questions we had (like how much the interest rate has changed) and tried to find data from the articles we found.  We also talked with people in our lives working in our chosen field of study about our proposal and took some suggestions from them on where to look or how to modify our scope (Shout out Kyle for helping us tighten up our definition of Millennial).  We also looked at the delveloper section on the Census Bureau and Federal Housing Administration, but after finding FRED (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis) and the data that site offered, we pulled our data sets from there
#After finding our data, we broke it up into areas of interest, and started cleaning.  Most of our data sets had the information sorted how we needed, but we did have to change the Data Types for columns within our Data Frames or take Samples of the data.
# **Question 1: How has the Federal Interest Rate Changed**
#The data I pulled for this question is from FRED, from the past 5 years.  We wanted to include the past 5 years because it looks at pre-COVID, during COVID, and "post"-COVID.  From this data, I can tell that post-COVID rates are just *slightly* above where they were pre-COVID.  I can also see that the lowest rate that we had was in the beginning of 2020, which makes sense because that's when COVID really hit.  I also noticed that the rates stayed below 0.5% through the rest of 2020, all of 2021, and at the beginning of 2022.  Personally, not really having a need to pay attention to the FED rate (whether I was living with my parents, the entire world was shut down, or I was already in a lease, I did not know that the FED rate stayed below 0.5% for so long, and I also had no idea that we just now surpassed
