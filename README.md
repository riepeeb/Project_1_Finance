#**Housing Market Analysis**
 #Hypothesis: The increase of Interest Rates will cause home buying by Millennials to decrease
  #Definitions in our Scope:
   #Millennial - a person aged 25-34
   #FFR - Federal Funds Rate
   #FMI - Fixed Mortgage Interest Rate
##For our project, we wanted to look at how the housing market has changed in the over the past 5 years.  We are all iaround the age that home buying is on our minds, so we wanted to look at trends concerning interest rates.  
#To do this, we first Googled questions we had (like how much the interest rate has changed) and tried to find data from the articles we found.  We also talked with people in our lives working in our chosen field of study about our proposal and took some suggestions from them on where to look or how to modify our scope (Shout out Kyle for helping us tighten up our definition of Millennial).  We also looked at the delveloper section on the Census Bureau and Federal Housing Administration, but after finding FRED (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis) and the data that site offered, we pulled our data sets from there
#After finding our data, we broke it up into areas of interest, and started cleaning.  Most of our data sets had the information sorted how we needed, but we did have to change the Data Types for columns within our Data Frames or take Samples of the data.
# **Question 1: How has the Federal Interest Rate Changed?**
#The data I pulled for this question is from FRED, from the past 5 years.  We wanted to include the past 5 years because it looks at pre-COVID, during COVID, and "post"-COVID.  From this data, I can tell that post-COVID rates are just *slightly* above where they were pre-COVID.  I can also see that the lowest rate that we had was in the beginning of 2020, which makes sense because that's when COVID really hit.  I also noticed that the rates stayed below 0.5% through the rest of 2020, all of 2021, and at the beginning of 2022.  Personally, not really having a need to pay attention to the FED rate (whether I was living with my parents, the entire world was shut down, or I was already in a lease, I did not know that the FED rate stayed below 0.5% for so long, and I also had no idea that we just now surpassed the pre-COVID rates
# **Question 2: How has the 30-Year FMI Rate Changed?**
#The data I pulled for this question is from FRED, from the past 5 years.  From this data, I was able to see how the FMI rate has quickly surpassed that of the pre-COVID rate.  I found the maximum value for pre-COVID and "post"-COVID.  Looking at the data further, it took over a year for the FMI rate to reach it's high pre-COVID, and it has now taken less than a year for it to go higher than that "post"-COVID.  Based on this data and my own thinking, I would guess that the rate at which Millennials are buying houses has slowed if not gone down. 
#**Question 3: How has the 15-Year FMI Rate Changed?**
# 
#**Question 4: What does the cost of Rent for Millennials look like over the past 5 years?**
#
#**Question 5: What do Expenses for Millennials look like over the past 5 years?**
#
#**Question 6: How has the number of Millennial Home Buyers Changed?**
#The data for this question was pulled from FRED from the past 5 years.  Based on the data found, home buying has actually gone up more than I would've thought given the rising interest and FMI rates.  Home Buying in 2017 was just under 20,000 dropping around 500 in 2018, going back up in 2019 and 2020, then growing to be 3000 more than the low in 2018.  I came to the conclusion that even though rates are still going up, as the Millennial age group that we looked at grows older, they have more capital, and are therefore more likely to buy a home.  
#**Conclusion:**
#Tying in Rilee's data on Rent prices, as those are rising as well, it makes sense that one would want to put that money towards a home that they might out-right own one day.  With more home owners in the dataset in 2021 it also makes sense that the amount of expenses would go up, higher taxes, mortgages are going up, and the costs of goods and services needed to maintain an entire home are going to be greater than what it would cost to rent a one bedroom apartment.
